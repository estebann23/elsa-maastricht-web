# WalletWallet API

REST API that issues passes to BOTH Apple Wallet and Google Wallet from one request. Send JSON, get a signed Apple `.pkpass` binary plus a Save to Google Wallet link (the `X-Google-Save-Url` response header). No Apple Developer or Google issuer account needed: WalletWallet signs Apple passes with its own Pass Type ID and WWDR chain, and mints Google save JWTs from its own issuer. Live updates and push work on both wallets.

The API has three write endpoints and one read endpoint. `POST /api/passes` creates a pass and returns a JSON envelope `{serialNumber, googleSaveUrl, applePass, shareUrl}` (shareUrl is a hosted, device-aware install page for the pass: it shows the right Add to Wallet button per device and a QR on desktop; the legacy `POST /api/pkpass` is the same handler but returns the `.pkpass` binary directly, with `X-Serial-Number`, `X-Google-Save-Url`, and `X-Pass-Url` headers). `PUT /api/passes/<serial>` updates an issued pass: every Apple device that installed it gets an APNs push and Wallet refreshes in place, and the Google object is updated and pushed at the same time. `DELETE /api/passes/<serial>` revokes an issued pass: Apple rebuilds it voided with a past expiration date and pushes the void to installed devices, and the Google object is set to expired, so the pass is invalidated on every device. `GET /api/auth/usage` returns the current month's counter. All requests use Bearer auth with keys formatted `ww_live_<32 hex chars>`. Unknown auth scheme, missing key, or wrong key returns 401.

Two push models, one call. Apple is device-pull: the phone-home URL is signed into the `.pkpass` and the device pulls a fresh pass over the PassKit web service. Google is server-push: WalletWallet PATCHes the Google object and sends an Add Message notification. The one honest difference: Apple shows your field `changeMessage` on the lock screen, while Google's update banner is generic and your text lives inside the pass.

Two plans gate features: **Free** and **Pro**. The Pro-only request fields are `color`, `logoURL`, `thumbnailURL`, `stripURL`, and `iconURL`. Everything else, `colorPreset`, all field arrays, `locations`, `organizationName`, `expirationDays`, `sharingProhibited`, PUT updates, works on Free. Usage resets on the 1st of each month (UTC). POST always counts on success; PUT counts only when the body actually changed (an unchanged PUT is a no-op, no push, no quota).

The API only supports two PassKit styles today: **generic** (default) and **storeCard** (auto-selected when you pass `stripURL`). `eventTicket`, `boardingPass`, and `coupon` are not exposed. Background images are not supported on generic passes, use `thumbnailURL` for a photo on the pass face.

## Base

- Base URL: `https://api.walletwallet.dev`
- Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer ww_live_<your_key>`
- Content type for write endpoints: `application/json`
- Errors are JSON: `{"error": "<message>"}`. Status codes: `400` validation, `401` bad/missing key, `403` serial belongs to another key, `404` unknown serial or unknown route, `405` wrong method, `429` monthly limit hit, `500` server error.

## POST /api/passes, create a pass

Returns the signed `.pkpass` file as `application/vnd.apple.pkpass`. The response carries these custom headers:

- `Content-Type: application/vnd.apple.pkpass`
- `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="<slug>.pkpass"` (slug derived from `title` or `logoText`, lowercased, non-alphanumerics replaced with `-`)
- `X-Serial-Number: <uuid>`, the server-generated serial. CORS-exposed via `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`. Save it if you ever want to update the pass. The same value is also embedded in `pass.json` inside the bundle.
- `X-Google-Save-Url: https://pay.google.com/gp/v/save/<jwt>`, the Save to Google Wallet link for the same pass. Open it on Android to install.

Legacy binary endpoint: `POST /api/pkpass` is the same handler but returns the raw `.pkpass` body by default (with the `X-Serial-Number`, `X-Google-Save-Url`, and `X-Pass-Url` headers). `?format=` overrides either default, so `/api/passes?format=binary` returns the binary and `/api/pkpass?format=json` returns the JSON envelope.

The body sent in by the caller is never echoed; you only get the binary back. Including `serialNumber` or `authenticationToken` in the request body returns 400, both are server-owned.

### Request body fields

At least one of `logoText`, `primaryFields`, or `title` must be present.

| Field | Type | Plan | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `barcodeValue` | string | All | No | Optional. Data encoded in the barcode. Max 512 chars. Omit it (or send an empty string) for a pass with no barcode. |
| `barcodeFormat` | string | All | No | Required only when you send a `barcodeValue`, in which case it must be one of `QR`, `PDF417`, `Aztec`, `Code128`. |
| `logoText` | string | All | No* | Text next to the logo (top-left). Max 64 chars. |
| `description` | string | All | No | Accessibility text, not visible. Max 128 chars. Defaults to `logoText` → `title` → `"Pass"`. |
| `organizationName` | string | All | No | Issuer name shown as the lock-screen banner title on updates, on lock-screen location-relevance surfaces, in the iOS share sheet, and in Wallet's pass info screen. Max 64 chars. Falls back to the account default. |
| `primaryFields` | array | All | No* | Main content. Up to 10 `{label?, value, changeMessage?}` objects. `label` is optional: omit it (or send an empty string) and the value renders alone with no label on both wallets. `label` ≤ 64 chars, `value` ≤ 256 chars, `changeMessage` ≤ 128 chars. |
| `secondaryFields` | array | All | No | Below primary. Same shape and limits as `primaryFields`. |
| `headerFields` | array | All | No | Top-right of pass, the only fields visible when the pass is stacked in Wallet. Same shape and limits. |
| `backFields` | array | All | No | Back of pass (tap the ⓘ). Same shape and limits. iOS auto-detects URLs, phone numbers, emails, addresses and makes them tappable. |
| `locations` | array | All | No | Up to 10 geofences. Each `{latitude, longitude, altitude?, relevantText?}`. `latitude` in [-90, 90], `longitude` in [-180, 180], `relevantText` ≤ 128 chars. Wallet surfaces the pass on the lock screen when the device is near a coordinate (uses significant-location-change service, surfacing can lag a minute or two). |
| `sharingProhibited` | boolean | All | No | Hides the Apple Wallet share button. Defaults to `true` (best for loyalty and membership cards). Set `false` to let holders share the pass, e.g. event or athlete cards. |
| `colorPreset` | string | All | No | One of `dark` (default), `blue`, `green`, `red`, `purple`, `orange`. |
| `expirationDays` | integer | All | No | Pass expires `N` days from issue. 1–3650. |
| `color` | string | Pro | No | Custom hex background, e.g. `#1e40af`. Foreground/label auto-derived from luminance. Overrides `colorPreset`. |
| `logoURL` | string | Pro | No | Brand mark on the pass face (top-left). HTTPS URL or `data:image/png;base64,...`. Private/internal IPs rejected. Recommended 160×160 px, max 1MB. |
| `thumbnailURL` | string | Pro | No | Small image, top-right of the pass face. Use for customer photos, product shots. HTTPS URL or PNG data URI. Recommended 180×180 px, max 1MB. |
| `stripURL` | string | Pro | No | Wide banner image behind the primary field. **Setting this switches the pass to `storeCard` style.** HTTPS URL or PNG data URI. Recommended 1080×360 px, max 1MB. |
| `iconURL` | string | Pro | No | Replaces the small square icon shown in iOS lock-screen notifications when the pass updates. Distinct from `logoURL`. HTTPS URL or PNG data URI. Recommended 120×120 px, max 1MB. |
| `title` | string | All | No* | Legacy. If set without `primaryFields`, becomes `primaryFields[0].value` and also fills `logoText` when that's missing. Max 64 chars. |
| `cardLabel` | string | All | No | Legacy. Sets `primaryFields[0].label` (defaults to `"CARD"` when omitted; an empty string means no label). Only used when `title` populates `primaryFields`. Max 32 chars. |
| `label` | string | All | No | Legacy. With `value`, becomes `secondaryFields[0]`. |
| `value` | string | All | No | Legacy. With `label`, becomes `secondaryFields[0]`. |

\* At least one of `logoText`, `primaryFields`, or `title` is required.

Size limits (each returns 400 when exceeded): every image is capped at 1MB (decoded), the request body at 2MB total, and the built `.pkpass` at 10MB.

### Example: minimal

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.walletwallet.dev/api/passes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ww_live_<your_key>" \
  -d '{
    "barcodeValue": "MEMBER-12345",
    "barcodeFormat": "QR",
    "logoText": "Membership Card"
  }'
# Returns JSON: { "serialNumber": "...", "googleSaveUrl": "https://pay.google.com/gp/v/save/...", "applePass": "<base64 .pkpass>", "shareUrl": "https://api.walletwallet.dev/p/..." }
```

All fields above are accepted on a single create call; this minimal example is the shape, not the limit. Worked examples (a full pass, Pro branding, JavaScript, Python) live in [llms-full.txt](https://walletwallet.dev/llms-full.txt), and the [docs](https://walletwallet.dev/docs) add more languages.

Note: Cloudflare's bot rules block the default `Python-urllib` user-agent at the edge. `requests`, `httpx`, `curl`, `node-fetch`, and similar libraries are fine. If using `urllib.request`, set a custom `User-Agent` header.

## PUT /api/passes/<serial>, update an issued pass

Replaces the stored body for `<serial>`. If the new body's canonical hash differs from the stored one, the server bumps `last_modified`, invalidates the cached `.pkpass` blob, and updates BOTH wallets. Apple: fans out an APNs push to every device registered for that serial; iOS wakes, pulls a fresh `.pkpass` over the PassKit web service, and replaces the pass in place. Google: PATCHes the Google object with the new content and sends an Add Message push. The Apple lock-screen banner text comes from any field's `changeMessage` template (`%@` is substituted with the new value); without one, iOS shows the default "Pass Updated". Google's update banner is generic; the changed content shows inside the pass.

Body shape is identical to `POST /api/passes`. Sending `serialNumber` or `authenticationToken` in the body returns 400.

### Response (200)

```json
{
  "serialNumber": "8f4c3a2e-...",
  "lastUpdated": 1778538208273,
  "notifiedDevices": 3,
  "unchanged": false
}
```

`lastUpdated` is a millisecond epoch integer. `notifiedDevices` is the count of registrations the push was fanned out to (does not guarantee delivery, that depends on APNs and the user's device state).

### Idempotent retries

If the new body is byte-equivalent to what's stored (same canonical hash), the response is:

```json
{
  "serialNumber": "8f4c3a2e-...",
  "lastUpdated": 1778538208273,
  "notifiedDevices": 0,
  "unchanged": true
}
```

No push fires. No quota consumed. Safe to retry.

### Status codes specific to PUT

- `400`, validation failure, or body includes `serialNumber` / `authenticationToken`
- `403`, serial exists but belongs to a different API key (intentionally generic, does not leak ownership)
- `404`, unknown serial
- `429`, monthly quota hit (only changed-body PUTs count toward quota; unchanged PUTs do not)

### Example: update a points balance and trigger a lock-screen banner

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.walletwallet.dev/api/passes/8f4c3a2e-... \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ww_live_<your_key>" \
  -d '{
    "barcodeValue": "LOYALTY-98765",
    "barcodeFormat": "QR",
    "logoText": "Bayroast Coffee",
    "primaryFields": [{"label": "CARD", "value": "Coffee Rewards"}],
    "secondaryFields": [
      {
        "label": "POINTS",
        "value": "500",
        "changeMessage": "You earned %@ points"
      }
    ],
    "colorPreset": "dark"
  }'
```

The customer's lock screen shows: **You earned 500 points**.

## DELETE /api/passes/<serial>, revoke a pass

Revokes a pass you issued: it is invalidated on every device it is installed on, on both wallets. Apple rebuilds the pass as voided with a past expiration date, so it greys out, drops its barcode, and files under the holder's expired passes; the change reaches installed devices on their next poll. Google sets the pass to expired and moves it to the holder's expired passes, which is effectively permanent. On both wallets the pass remains in the holder's wallet, marked invalid, until they remove it: revocation invalidates the pass and the platform stops honoring it. The legacy alias `DELETE /api/pkpass/<serial>` works the same way. No request body is needed; any body is ignored.

### Response (200)

```json
{
  "serialNumber": "8f4c3a2e-...",
  "deleted": true,
  "googleRevoked": true,
  "notifiedDevices": 3,
  "lastUpdated": 1778538208273
}
```

`deleted: true` means the server revoked the pass and attempted the push, not that any device has updated yet. `googleRevoked` reports the Google result for this call (`true` on success, `false` if the Google update failed, omitted when Google is not configured). `notifiedDevices` is the count of Apple registrations the empty push was fanned out to. There is no un-revoke.

### Idempotent retries

A repeat DELETE on an already-revoked pass is a no-op success:

```json
{
  "serialNumber": "8f4c3a2e-...",
  "deleted": true,
  "alreadyDeleted": true,
  "notifiedDevices": 0
}
```

### Status codes specific to DELETE

- `401`, missing or invalid key
- `404`, unknown serial, or a serial owned by a different key (revoke collapses both to 404 and never reveals another account's serial)
- `429`, monthly quota hit

### Example

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.walletwallet.dev/api/passes/8f4c3a2e-... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ww_live_<your_key>"
```

## Share a pass

Every created pass has a hosted install page. `POST /api/passes` returns its URL as `shareUrl` (the legacy binary endpoint returns it as the `X-Pass-Url` response header). It looks like `https://api.walletwallet.dev/p/<serial>`.

Send that one link to a user by email, SMS, a chat message, or an "Add to Wallet" button on a confirmation page. The page detects the visitor's device and shows the right option:

- iPhone: an Add to Apple Wallet button installs the signed pass directly.
- Android: a Save to Google Wallet button adds the same pass to Google Wallet.
- Desktop: a QR code so the visitor can scan it and add the pass from their phone.

The page is branded from the pass itself (logo and color), so it looks like your pass, not a generic install screen. No app to install, nothing to host yourself. The link stays live for the life of the pass, and the same `<serial>` is the handle you use for `PUT /api/passes/<serial>` updates.

## GET /api/auth/usage

Returns the current month's stats for the authenticated key.

```bash
curl https://api.walletwallet.dev/api/auth/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ww_live_<your_key>"
```

Response (200):

```json
{
  "count": 150,
  "limit": 1000,
  "remaining": 850,
  "resetDate": "2026-06-01",
  "plan": "free"
}
```

`plan` is `free`, `trial`, `pro`, or `byok`. A new account starts on `trial`, which carries Pro's limits and features for 30 days and then reverts to `free` unless you subscribe; a live trial also returns `trialExpiresAt`. `resetDate` is the first of the next month (UTC).

## BYOK — bring your own Apple and Google credentials

`byok` is a managed plan for customers who sign Apple passes with their own Pass Type ID and mint Google passes from their own issuer. Feature access matches Pro, with a much higher monthly operation cap. It is not self-serve: there is no purchase flow and it is never assigned automatically. Ask support to onboard you.

Credentials are managed under `/api/credentials` (Bearer auth, `byok` plan only; every other plan gets 403). Apple private keys are never uploaded: `POST /api/credentials/apple/csr` generates the keypair server-side and returns a certificate signing request, you upload that to the Apple Developer portal, then post the issued `.cer` back to `POST /api/credentials/apple/certificate`. `GET /api/credentials` reports the status of each unit (Apple, APNs, Google) without echoing secret material, and `DELETE` removes one.

Two BYOK behaviors differ from Free and Pro:

- `applePass` is omitted from the `POST /api/passes` envelope when a `byok` account has configured Google but not Apple. On Free, on Pro, and on any `byok` account with an Apple unit, `applePass` is always present.
- Deleting an Apple unit that still has live passes returns `409` unless you pass `?force=true`. After a forced delete those passes serve cached blobs and any rebuild returns `410 Gone`, which tells Apple Wallet to unregister the pass permanently. Claiming a pass type identifier or Google issuer id that another account already registered also returns `409`.

An Apple unit with no APNs key signs passes correctly but can never push an update, so installed passes go stale with no error. Add the APNs key.

## Errors

All non-2xx responses return JSON `{"error": "..."}`. Rate-limit responses additionally include `resetDate` and `message`:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "resetDate": "2026-06-01",
  "message": "Monthly limit reached. Resets on 2026-06-01"
}
```

Common validation messages: `barcodeValue must be 512 characters or less`, `barcodeFormat must be one of: QR, PDF417, Aztec, Code128`, `At least one of title, primaryFields, or logoText is required`, `color is only available on the Pro plan`, `expirationDays must be between 1 and 3650`, `locations[0].latitude must be between -90 and 90`, `<field>URL must use HTTPS protocol`.

## Field-to-pass map

What ends up where on the pass face. One `PassRequest` maps to both wallets; placement differs because each wallet has its own layout.

- `logoURL` + `logoText` → Apple: top-left (brand wordmark). Google: logo top-left + cardTitle.
- `headerFields` → Apple: top-right (the only fields visible when the pass is stacked). Google: a row on the card front.
- `thumbnailURL` → Apple: top-right square slot (generic style only; conflicts with `stripURL`). Google: shows in the pass DETAILS view, not the front.
- `primaryFields` → Apple: large center value. Google: first primary becomes the header + subheader (no subheader when the label is blank).
- `secondaryFields` → Apple: below primary, side-by-side. Google: a column row on the card front.
- `stripURL` → Apple: wide banner behind primary fields (switches style to `storeCard`). Google: rendered as a full-width hero image at the BOTTOM of the card.
- `barcodeValue` + `barcodeFormat` → bottom of pass (both wallets).
- `backFields` → Apple: flip side (tap ⓘ); iOS makes URLs/phones/emails tappable. Google: pass details view.
- `iconURL` → Apple only: the icon in the lock-screen update notification and Wallet search. Not used by Google.
- `organizationName` → Apple: title of the lock-screen update notification, share sheet, pass info. Google: issuer/brand.
- `locations` → Apple: surfaces the pass on the lock screen (with `relevantText`) when near a coordinate. Google: maps to `merchantLocations` (geofence proximity notification, max 10), with no custom lock-screen text. NOTE: `relevantText` is Apple-only.

## How updates actually work

Two mechanisms, one PUT. **Apple (device-pull):** the server bakes `webServiceURL` and a server-generated `authenticationToken` into every `pass.json`. On install, iOS calls `POST <webServiceURL>/v1/devices/.../registrations/...` to register, sending its APNs push token. When a PUT changes the body, the server fans out an APNs push (empty payload, a wake signal), iOS calls back, then pulls the new `.pkpass` and refreshes in place. **Google (server-push):** the server holds a Google issuer service account; on PUT it gets an OAuth token, PATCHes the Google object with the rebuilt content, and sends an Add Message push to every device that saved the pass. You don't implement any of this for either wallet; calling PUT is the whole integration.

## Google Wallet specifics

- Install: `POST /api/passes` returns `googleSaveUrl` in the JSON body (the legacy binary `/api/pkpass` returns it as the `X-Google-Save-Url` header), a `https://pay.google.com/gp/v/save/<jwt>` link. Opening it on Android adds the pass. `GET /api/passes/<serial>/google` is a public 302 to that link for use in an `<a href>` button.
- Hosted page: `GET /p/<serial>` is a public page that shows the right Add button per device (Apple on iPhone, Google on Android) plus a desktop QR. No auth, the unguessable serial is the capability.
- Install-state callback: `POST /webhooks/google-wallet` receives Google's signed save/remove events; the per-serial state surfaces in `GET /api/passes/<serial>` next to Apple's `devices[]`.
- Layout: Google's generic card differs from Apple's, see the Field-to-pass map above (hero image at the bottom, thumbnail in details, secondary/header fields on the front, no lock-screen relevance text).
- Field cap: with Google enabled, the fields mapped to Google's text rows (secondary, header, and back fields combined) are capped at 10; a body exceeding that returns 400. Apple has no equivalent combined cap. `locations` are still capped at 10 on both.

## Pass styles supported

| API behavior | PassKit style produced |
|---|---|
| No `stripURL` | `generic` |
| `stripURL` provided | `storeCard` |

`eventTicket`, `boardingPass`, and `coupon` are not exposed today. Google passes use the Google Wallet generic class.

## Common patterns

### Update one field and let `%@` substitute the new value

For a value-change update with a templated banner (e.g. "Now at 1,300 points"), put `changeMessage` on the field whose value is changing:

```json
PUT /api/passes/<serial>
{
  "headerFields": [{
    "label": "POINTS",
    "value": "1,300",
    "changeMessage": "Now at %@ points"
  }]
}
```

The wallet substitutes `%@` with the new `value` at push time.

### Send a notification

To push a custom lock-screen notification on demand, ship a `backFields` "notification anchor". Put the user's message in `value`, and set `changeMessage` to literally `"%@"`. The wallet substitutes `%@` with the new `value` at render time, so the banner reads whatever you wrote in `value`.

Two mechanics make the seed-then-bump pattern necessary. The notification fires only when a field's *value* actually changes between pass versions. And your `changeMessage` text is honored only when it contains `%@`; without it, the banner falls back to a generic "Pass Changed" string.

The anchor has to exist on the pass before you try to use it. Seed it on the POST that creates the pass:

```json
POST /api/passes
{
  ...,
  "backFields": [
    { "label": "Notifications", "value": " ", "changeMessage": "%@" }
  ]
}
```

Then on each send, bump `value` to the message you want and keep `changeMessage` as `"%@"`:

```json
PUT /api/passes/<serial>
{
  ...,
  "backFields": [
    { "label": "Notifications", "value": "Free coffee on us!", "changeMessage": "%@" }
  ]
}
```

A few practical notes:

- The anchor lives in `backFields` so it doesn't crowd the pass face. Customers only see "Notifications: <last message>" if they tap ⓘ to flip the pass.
- Keep the `backFields` array order stable between POST and every PUT. Fields are identified by position; reordering the array re-keys the anchor and the banner stops firing on it.
- If you skip the POST seed, the first PUT introduces the anchor as a brand-new field, which is treated as "no value change" and silently suppresses the banner. Subsequent sends work because the anchor now exists, so only the first is silent.
- Sending the same message text twice in a row is a no-op. The value did not change, so no banner fires. Vary the text, or bump to something distinct, if you need a repeat.
